# weatherAppStarter
If you had any trouble setting up the working environment for the app in the last two videos of my course on Iterators and Generators, then you can download the code contained in this repo and have a clean starting point.

Don't forget, after downloading, to run "npm install" at the command line in the app directory in order to install the required dependency.
